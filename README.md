# 100DaysOfCode

On October 8, 2018, I started the challenge of **100 Days Of Code** challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for 100 days. The problems will be selected from HackerRank, CodeChef and GeeksForGeeks. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. 

I believe that the length of the code doesn't matter until the logic is right and hence, cannot be a quality parameter. I expect this challenge to be a wonderful experience. For any suggestions, feel free to mail me at dasoriyarayan@gmail.com

## Day 1
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on arrays.

1. The first problem is related to the maximum of the hourglass sum. Refer to Day1/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the hourglass sum. 

2. The second problem is related to array manipulation. It returns the maximum value from an array after overlapping and adding the contents of it. Refer to Day1/Problem 2.pdf for a detailed explanation.


## Day 2
Solved 3 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on different topics.

1. The first problem is related to the time complexity of prime number verification. Refer to Day2/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The second problem is related to Regular Expressions. It should return the sorted list of the names if the email domain of the person is gmail.com. Refer to Day2/Problem 2.pdf for a detailed explanation.

3. The third problem is related to the removal of duplicate values from the Linked List. Refer to Day2/Problem 3.pdf for a detailed explanation.

## Day 3
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Java. The problems are based on different topics.

1. The first problem is related to RegEx to remove the repeated words from a sentence. Refer to Day3/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The second problem is related to the XOR calculation. It should return the number of terms which are greater than the later number and XOR calculated value. Refer to Day3/Problem 2.pdf for a detailed explanation.

## Day 4
Solved 1 coding problem from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on arrays.

1. The problem is related to the sorting of an array to count the number of Fraudulent notifications. It was a challenging one. Refer to Day4/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

## Day 5
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python and C++. The problems are based on arrays.

1. The problem is related to Anagrams which deals with finding all the possible substrings within a string which can form an anagram. Refer to Day5/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The problem is related to Bribe in which we have to consider if the bribe giving is possible or chaotic. Refer to Day5/Problem 2.pdf for detailed information.  (PS: I don't support bribes :p)

## Day 6
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based searching algorithms.

1. The problem is related to the minimum change of sum require to form a magic square (diagonal, row and column sum of a matrix is the same). Refer to Day6/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The problem is related to the options to test the ice cream flavors having certain constraints. Refer to Day6/Problem 2.pdf for detailed information. 

## Day 7
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on different topics.

1. The problem is related to the Lexicographical order to find the next highest word in the dictionary. Refer to Day7/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The problem is related to finding a subset of an array whose sum is not a multiple of a given number.  Refer to Day7/Problem 2.pdf for detailed information.
