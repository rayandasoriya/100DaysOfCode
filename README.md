# 100DaysOfCode

On October 8, 2018, I started the challenge of **100 Days Of Code** challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for 100 days. The problems will be selected from HackerRank, CodeChef and GeeksForGeeks. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. 

I believe that the length of the code doesn't matter until the logic is right and hence, cannot be a quality parameter. I expect this challenge to be a wonderful experience. For any suggestions, feel free to mail me at dasoriyarayan@gmail.com
