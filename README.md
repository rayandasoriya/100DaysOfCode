# 100DaysOfCode

On October 8, 2018, I started the challenge of **100 Days Of Code** challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for 100 days. The problems will be selected from HackerRank, CodeChef and GeeksForGeeks. I will be coding most of the part in Python. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. I believe that the length of the code doesn't matter until the logic is right and hence, cannot be a quality parameter. I expect this challenge to be a wonderful experience. For any suggestions, feel free to mail me at dasoriyarayan@gmail.com

## Day 1
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on arrays.

1. The first problem is related to the maximum of the hourglass sum. Refer to Problem 1 for more information regarding the hourglass sum. 

2. The second problem is related to array manipulation. It returns the maximum value from an array after overlapping and adding the contents of it. Refer to Problem 2 for a detailed explanation.
