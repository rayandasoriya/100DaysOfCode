# 100DaysOfCode

On October 8, 2018, I started the challenge of **100 Days Of Code** challenge. During the course of this challenge, I pledge to code for 100 days. The problems will be selected from HackerRank, CodeChef and GeeksForGeeks. The code will be pushed iff all the test cases are successful. I believe that the length of the code doesn't matter until the logic is right and hence, cannot be a quality parameter. I expect this challenge to be a wonderful experience. For any suggestions, feel free to mail me at dasoriyarayan@gmail.com

## Day 1
Solved 2 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on arrays.

1. The first problem is related to the maximum of the hourglass sum. Refer to Day1/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the hourglass sum. 

2. The second problem is related to array manipulation. It returns the maximum value from an array after overlapping and adding the contents of it. Refer to Day1/Problem 2.pdf for a detailed explanation.


## Day 2
Solved 3 coding problems from HackerRank using Python. The problems are based on different topics.

1. The first problem is related to the time complexity of prime number verification. Refer to Day2/Problem 1.pdf for more information regarding the problem. 

2. The second problem is related to Regular Expressions. It should return the sorted list of the names if the email domain of the person is gmail.com. Refer to Day2/Problem 2.pdf for a detailed explanation.

3. The third problem is related to the removal of duplicate values from the Linked List. Refer to Day2/Problem 3.pdf for a detailed explanation.

## Day 3
